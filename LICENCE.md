Why build this?

    Existing finance apps treat kids as afterthoughts (allowance trackers are too simple)
    Credit education happens too late (after kids already have real credit cards)
    Parents want to teach financial literacy but lack tools that bridge theory and practice
    Gamification can make learning engaging without trivializing serious concepts

What makes this different?

    Learners experience real financial mechanics (interest, credit scores, loan agreements)
    Parents maintain full oversight while giving kids meaningful autonomy
    The pain of bad financial decisions is educational, not catastrophic
    It grows with the family (start young with simple tasks, scale to complex agreements)

Future Vision: If this proves valuable, release as an open-source project with:

    Easy deployment (Docker one-liner or hosted service)
    Plug-in architecture for custom task types, agreement terms
    Community-contributed educational content
    Optional paid hosting for non-technical families

# 📞 Support & Contributing

Issues: https://github.com/RabitStudiosCanada/Family_Finance_Tracker/issues

This is a personal project currently under active development. Once stable, contribution guidelines will be added.

*Current Status: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT / INTERNAL ALPHA TESTING - Phase 2 COMPLETE (Nov 11, 2025)*

Remember: This is a tool for education and habit-building. The real goal isn't perfect budgets or maximized credit scores - it's raising financially literate, responsible humans who understand that money is a tool, not a mystery.
